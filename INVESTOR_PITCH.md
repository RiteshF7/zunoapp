# Zuno — Investor Pitch

## Open with

Everyone saves stuff—reels, articles, videos. Then we forget where we put it. Instagram has saves, YouTube has Watch Later, Twitter has bookmarks, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Pocket, notes, screenshots. Nothing talks to anything else. So you end up with a dozen mini-libraries and no way to ask “what was that recipe video?” or “those TypeScript articles” without opening six apps and scrolling.

Zuno is one place. You share into it from any app—one tap, Share → Zuno—or paste a link. AI sorts and tags it. You search in your own words. Your saved content actually becomes usable.

## The problem (say it once)

- **Fragmented.** Every platform has its own save. No single library. People already save a lot; the habit’s there. The experience is broken.
- **Unfindable.** No cross-app search. No “ask in plain language.” So people scroll, guess, or give up. Stuff they meant to keep is effectively lost.
- **Static.** Big save piles become clutter. Manual organizing is tedious; almost nobody keeps up. Most saved content never gets used again.
- **Siloed.** Platforms don’t use what you save to recommend new things. Your taste is locked inside each app.

## What Zuno does (one pass—no repeat)

One library for everything you save, from any app. Share → Zuno or paste URL. AI categorizes, tags, summarizes—no filing. You search in natural language and can ask things like “what did I save about productivity?” and get answers with sources. We also surface a personalized “For You” feed based on what you actually save, and we infer goals from your saves and suggest steps. So: one place, AI organization, search in your words, discovery and goals from your own library.

## Why we’re not “just another bookmark app”

We’re not Pocket-for-links. We’re the hub for every format—reels, videos, articles, posts, threads—from every major platform. One Share target, one library, one search. And the AI does the organizing; users save, we make it findable. That’s the bet.

## Demo flow (speaking order)

1. Problem: “Your content is everywhere.” (Show scattered apps.)
2. Solution: “One tap from any app.” (Share → Zuno.)
3. AI: “It understands and organizes.” (Tags, summary, collections.)
4. Search: “Find anything in seconds.” (Natural language, Ask Zuno.)
5. Discovery: “It finds more you’ll like.” (Feed from your saves.)
6. Smarter over time: “More you save, smarter it gets.” (Digest, reminders, goals.)

---

## Opportunity

People already save. We’re not creating the behavior—we’re fixing it. Nobody owns “all my saves from everywhere” yet. And the AI layer—natural language search, goals, “why this?”—is what makes it stick and worth talking about.

---

## Why now

Share sheets and deep links are standard; “Share to Zuno” works everywhere. AI is good enough that categorization and search feel like “it gets me.” And users are tired of losing what they save. The pain is daily.

---

## Business model

Freemium (limited saves, basic AI; premium for unlimited + advanced AI + collaboration). Pro tier: unlimited, extension, voice, priority AI. Team: shared collections, admin. Plus API for power users.

## Close

We’re building the place where everything you save from every app finally lives—organized, searchable in plain language, and connected to discovery and goals. Would love to show you the product. One tap to save, one search to find.
