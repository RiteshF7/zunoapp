# Share to Zuno – Chrome Extension

Save any page or link to your Zuno library from Chrome. Shows a notification when shared — no redirect.

## Install (developer mode)

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `chrome-extension` folder

## First-time setup: Connect

1. Log in to Zuno at [zunoapp.onrender.com/app](https://zunoapp.onrender.com/app/)
2. Go to **Profile** → **Connect Extension**
3. A new tab opens; the extension receives your token and shows "Extension connected!"
4. The tab closes automatically

## How to share

- **Right-click** page, link, or selected URL text → **Share to Zuno** → notification "Shared to Zuno!"
- **Click extension icon** → **Share this page** → notification "Shared to Zuno!"

When not connected, right-click opens the Zuno app so you can connect or save manually.

## Contexts

- **Page**: Right-click anywhere on a page → saves current page URL
- **Link**: Right-click on a link → saves the link URL
- **Selection**: Select text that contains a URL → Right-click → saves the URL

> The address bar is not a web page, so "Share to Zuno" does not appear when right-clicking there. Use the **extension icon** to share the current tab instead.
