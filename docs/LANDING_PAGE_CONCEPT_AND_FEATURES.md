# Zuno — Landing Page: App Concept & Features

Use this copy and structure when building or updating the public landing page (e.g. www.zuno.com) so visitors immediately understand what Zuno does.

---

## App concept (hero / above the fold)

**Focus:** **Share from anywhere. Search anytime.**

### One-liner
**Zuno is your one place for everything you save — from every app.**

### Tagline options (pick one or rotate)
- **Share from anywhere. Search anytime.**
- **One place. AI organizes. You search in your words.**
- **Your Knowledge Network**
- **Save from anywhere. Find in one place.**

### Short paragraph (2–3 sentences)
Zuno is a unified content hub. **Share from anywhere** — save reels, articles, videos, and posts from Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and more with one tap (Share → Zuno) or paste a URL. AI categorizes and organizes everything. **Search anytime** in plain language over *your* library — personalized results from your saves, so you can find “that recipe video I saved last month” or “articles about TypeScript” in seconds.

## What problem Zuno solves (for “Why Zuno” or “The problem” section)

- **Content is everywhere.** You save in one app, bookmark in another, “watch later” somewhere else. No single place.
- **Finding it later is hard.** No unified search, no way to ask in plain language across all your saves.
- **Saved content becomes useless.** Hundreds of items with no structure — manual filing is tedious and rarely happens.

**Zuno fixes this:** one library for all your saves (share from anywhere), AI that organizes automatically, and search anytime in natural language — personalized to your content.

## Core features (for “Features” section on the landing page)

Present these as scannable cards or a short list. Each item = one clear benefit.

| Feature | Short headline | One-line description |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Share from anywhere** | Save from any app or URL | Save reels, articles, videos, and posts from any app with one tap (Share → Zuno) or paste a URL. No copy-paste, no switching apps. |
| **One library** | Everything in one place | All your saved content — from Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and more — lives in a single library. |
| **Search anytime** | Natural language, personalized to you | Search over *your* saved content in plain language. Results are personalized to your library — not the whole web. |
| **AI organization** | Auto-categorized & tagged | Content is automatically tagged and grouped (e.g. Ideas, Research, Personal, by topic) so you don’t file everything manually. |
| **Smart summaries** | Know what you saved at a glance | AI generates short summaries for each item so you can scan your library without opening every link. |
| **Natural language search** | Search like you talk | Find things with phrases like “that recipe video I saved last month” or “articles about TypeScript” — personalized content from your saves, no keywords required. |
| **Ask your library** | Ask Zuno | Ask questions about your saved content and get answers with sources — like a smart assistant for your library. |
| **Collections** | Browse by topic or project | Content is grouped into collections (e.g. Important Docs, Learning, Creative) so you can browse by theme. |
| **Personalized discovery** | Discover more of what you like | Get a “For You” feed of related content from across the web, tailored to what you save. |
| **Goals** | Goals from what you save | AI detects what you're working toward from your saves and suggests actionable steps tied to your content. |

### Goals in detail (for landing page or "How it works")

- **Automatic** — Zuno infers goals from your saved content (e.g. "Master AI video editing," "Plan a trip"). No manual goal entry.
- **Actionable steps** — Each goal has steps linked to your saved items (e.g. "Watch the saved Runway tutorial," "Apply tips from the saved article"). You can mark steps complete.
- **Search anytime** — Your library and your goals stay connected; find content by goal or by natural language search over the same library.
- **You're in control** — Complete, dismiss, or merge goals; edit titles and descriptions if you want.

## Suggested landing page structure

1. **Hero** — Focus: **Share from anywhere. Search anytime.** One-liner + tagline + short paragraph + primary CTA.
2. **Problem** — 3 bullets (content everywhere, hard to find, becomes useless).
3. **Solution** — “Zuno is the one place…” + 1–2 sentences.
4. **Features** — 6–10 feature cards (use table above); highlight Share from anywhere, Search anytime, and Goals; each: icon, headline, one line.
5. **How it works** (optional) — 3 steps: Share from anywhere → Zuno organizes → Search anytime (personalized to your content).
6. **Goals** (optional) — Short blurb: AI detects goals from your saves and suggests actionable steps.
