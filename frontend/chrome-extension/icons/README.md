# Extension icons

Chrome needs PNGs at 16×16, 48×48, and 128×128. Placeholder 1×1 PNGs are included so the extension loads without errors.

**To use the Zuno logo in the toolbar:** Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser and download the three PNGs, then replace `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png` in this folder and reload the extension.

**Or:** Export PNGs from `../assets/logo.svg` at 16, 48, and 128 px and name them as above.
