# Zuno — Investor Pitch

**Your one place for everything you save. From every app.**

---

## The Hook

We save hundreds of articles, reels, and videos every year—and then we lose them. Not because we didn’t care, but because they’re trapped inside a dozen different apps with no single search, no organization, and no way to ask: *“What was that thing I saved?”*

**Zuno turns that chaos into one personal library.** Share from anywhere. Search in your own words. Let AI organize it—so your saved content actually works for you.

---

## The Problem: Content Is Everywhere, But Nowhere

### 1. **Scattered across every app**
- Instagram saves. YouTube “Watch Later.” Twitter bookmarks. LinkedIn saved posts. Pinterest boards. Pocket. Notes. Screenshots.
- **There is no single place.** Each platform keeps its own silo. Users jump between five or six “save” systems and still can’t find what they need.

### 2. **Finding it later is a nightmare**
- No unified search. No way to ask in plain language: *“That recipe video from last month”* or *“Articles about learning TypeScript.”*
- People end up scrolling, guessing, or giving up. **The content they intentionally saved becomes effectively lost.**

### 3. **Saved content becomes useless**
- Without structure, big libraries turn into digital clutter. Organizing manually is tedious; most people don’t do it. **The bulk of saved content is never used again.**

### 4. **No real discovery from what you save**
- Platforms don’t connect what you save across apps. They don’t recommend *new* content based on *your* saved interests. **Your taste is locked inside each app.**

## What We’re Solving (Pain Points → Zuno)

| Pain point | Zuno’s answer |
|------------|----------------|
| Content stuck in 10+ apps | **One library.** Share from any app (Share → Zuno) or paste a URL. Everything in one place. |
| “I can’t find it” | **Search in your words.** Natural language over *your* library—no folders, no hashtag hunting. |
| Manual organizing is a chore | **AI organizes.** Auto-categories, tags, summaries. Zero filing. |
| Saved stuff feels dead | **Ask your library.** “What did I save about productivity?” — answers with sources. |
| No discovery tied to my taste | **Personalized feed.** “For You” based on what you actually save, across all platforms. |
| Goals get lost in the noise | **Goals from your saves.** AI infers what you’re working toward and suggests steps from your content. |

## The Solution in One Line

**Share from anywhere. Search anytime.**

- **Save:** One tap from Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, or any app with Share → Zuno (or paste a URL).
- **Organize:** AI categorizes, tags, and summarizes—no manual filing.
- **Find:** Natural language search, collections, and “Ask Zuno” over your library.
- **Discover:** A personalized feed that gets better the more you save.

---

## Why It’s Different

- **Not another bookmark app.** We’re not “Pocket for links”—we’re the **one hub for every type of content** (reels, videos, articles, posts, threads) from every major platform, with AI that actually organizes and search that speaks your language.
- **Not per-app.** Native Share → Zuno from any app. One library. One search. One “personality” of what you care about.
- **Not manual.** AI does the tagging and grouping. Users save; we make it findable and useful.

## How It Works (Simple Story for Investors)

1. **Problem** — “Your content is everywhere.” (Visual: scattered app icons.)
2. **Solution** — “One tap from any app.” (Share → Zuno.)
3. **AI** — “AI understands and organizes.” (Tags, summary, smart collections.)
4. **Search** — “Find anything in seconds.” (Natural language, Ask Zuno.)
5. **Discovery** — “AI finds what you’ll love.” (Personalized feed from your saves.)
6. **Smarter over time** — “The more you save, the smarter it gets.” (Digest, reminders, goals, collaborative collections.)

---

## The Opportunity

- **Behavior is already there:** People already save aggressively; the habit exists. We’re not creating demand—we’re fixing a broken experience.
- **Cross-platform is the gap:** No incumbent owns “all my saves from everywhere.” That space is open.
- **AI makes it stick:** Organization and search that feel magical (natural language, goals, “Why this?”) drive retention and word of mouth.

---

## Business Model (High Level)

- **Freemium:** Limited saves and basic AI; premium for unlimited + advanced AI + collaborative features.
- **Pro:** Unlimited saves, browser extension, voice search, priority AI.
- **Team:** Shared collections and admin for teams.
- **API:** For power users and integrations.

---

## Why Now

- **Share sheets and deep links** are standard; “Share to Zuno” works everywhere.
- **AI (categorization, summarization, semantic search)** is good enough to deliver a “it just gets me” experience.
- **Users are tired** of losing what they save. The pain is real and daily.

## Call to Action

We’re building the **one place** where everything people save from every app finally lives—organized by AI, searchable in plain language, and connected to discovery and goals.

**We’d love to show you Zuno.** One tap to save. One search to find. One library for life.
